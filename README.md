# InfraLog

InfraLog is a Django-based **infrastructure logging system** designed to manage, organize, and monitor logs across multiple projects from a single dashboard.

It demonstrates how modern backend systems handle **centralized logging**, severity tracking, and project-wise system monitoring instead of relying on scattered log files.

## Purpose

The purpose of InfraLog is to provide a structured way to:

- Track application and system logs per project
- Classify logs based on severity
- Monitor system behavior through a centralized interface

This reflects real-world backend and DevOps logging practices used in production environments.
